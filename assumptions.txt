Assumptions:

1. DOB VALIDATION
   Assumption: A user's date of birth cannot be in the future or older than 120 years.
   Reason: Invalid DOBs (like 2050) would cause validation errors and logic failures.

2. SOFT DELETE POLICY
   Assumption: User and Account deletions are logical (IsDeleted = true), not physical.
   Reason: Hard deletes could break audit trails and foreign key relationships.

3. ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP RULE
   Assumption: A user can only view their own accounts, except branch managers who can view accounts in their branch.
   Reason: Prevents unauthorized access and enforces data security.

4. TERM DEPOSIT TYPE
   Assumption: Term Deposits are treated as a type of account with MaturityDate and InterestRate fields.
   Reason: Ensures consistent handling within the account hierarchy.

5. UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS
   Assumption: Email (User) and AccountNumber (Account) are globally unique.
   Reason: Prevents duplication and authentication conflicts.

6. AUTHENTICATION METHOD
   Assumption: System uses JWT authentication, with RS256 (private/public keys) for token security.
   Reason: Defines how roles and permissions are enforced.

7. BRANCH MANAGER RELATIONSHIP
   Assumption: Each branch has exactly one Branch Manager (Bank User with Manager role).
   Reason: Required for correct authorization of “view accounts in my branch”.

8. MULTI-CURRENCY HANDLING
   Assumption: Accounts use ISO 4217 currency codes (e.g., INR, USD) and do not allow currency conversion.
   Reason: Avoids inaccurate balance calculations across currencies.

9. TRANSACTION ATOMICITY
   Assumption: Deposit and withdrawal operations are performed as atomic DB transactions.
   Reason: Ensures balance consistency and prevents partial updates.
